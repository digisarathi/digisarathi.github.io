An intuitive mobile app for on-site employees of a leading Indian staffing company. 33000+ users from across India connected to their HR 24/7.

Our research indicated Android and Windows (Nokia phones) to be the bigger chunk of users and these platforms is what we created the mobile app for. To be faster in deployment and save costs for our client, we avoided the native app route and instead adopted the hybrid app architecture. This allowed us to have a common code base for Android and Windows so new features could be rolled out for both platforms in no time.
